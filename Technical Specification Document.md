**3. Technical Specification Document**

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI (MUI) for user interface components.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for handling REST API endpoints and core logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data management, ensuring ACID compliance for transactions.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure and stateless user sessions.
- **Messaging System**: Socket.IO for real-time communication between lawyers and consumers.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, AWS for scalable hosting.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for code versioning and collaboration.

### Architectural Overview:
The application will use a three-tier architecture consisting of the following components:
1. **Frontend (Client Side)**
   - React.js provides the user interface for both lawyers and consumers.
   - Material-UI (MUI) will be used for components such as forms, dialogs, and dashboards, providing a modern and responsive interface.
   - State management with React Context API or Redux for managing user sessions and application state.

2. **Backend (Server Side)**
   - The backend is built using FastAPI, which provides a fast and efficient way to manage RESTful services.
   - Endpoints for registration, login, request management, and messaging.
   - Implements business logic to validate user actions, such as ensuring only available lawyers can pick up requests.

3. **Database Layer**
   - **PostgreSQL** serves as the primary data store, managing users, requests, profiles, and messages.
   - Use of **SQLAlchemy ORM** for data modeling and interaction between the database and backend.
   - Indexing frequently queried fields like `request_status`, `specialization`, and `picked_by_lawyer_id` for improved query performance.

4. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication, allowing secure and scalable user sessions.
   - Role-based access control: Lawyers and consumers have different permissions and access scopes, implemented through middleware that checks JWT claims.

### Core Modules & Their Functionality:
1. **User Management**:
   - Registration and login services for both consumers and lawyers.
   - Profile management endpoints allowing users to update personal details.
   - **Endpoints**:
     - `POST /register` - Register a new user (either lawyer or consumer).
     - `POST /login` - Authenticate users and provide a JWT.
     - `PUT /profile/{user_id}` - Update profile information.

2. **Request Management**:
   - Consumers create requests for legal help; lawyers pick from available requests.
   - Status tracking for requests from creation to completion.
   - **Endpoints**:
     - `POST /requests` - Create a new request (Consumer only).
     - `GET /requests` - List available requests (Lawyer only).
     - `PATCH /requests/{request_id}` - Pick a request and mark it as assigned.
     - `PUT /requests/{request_id}/complete` - Mark a request as completed.

3. **Messaging System**:
   - **Real-time messaging** between consumers and lawyers using **Socket.IO**.
   - The messaging system will facilitate secure communication, allowing both parties to share documents and discuss case details.
   - **Endpoints**:
     - `POST /requests/{request_id}/messages` - Send a message.
     - `GET /requests/{request_id}/messages` - Get the message history for a request.

4. **Notification System**:
   - Real-time notifications when a lawyer picks a request or when a message is received.
   - Push notifications using **WebSockets** to keep both parties updated on any changes.

5. **Frontend Features**:
   - **Responsive Design**: Material-UI ensures a smooth experience across different screen sizes.
   - **Forms and Validation**: Registration, request creation, and messaging forms with client-side validation.
   - **Real-Time Updates**: State changes (e.g., request acceptance, messages) update instantly using Socket.IO.

### Deployment & Infrastructure:
- **Containerization**: Using **Docker** to containerize both the backend and frontend for consistency across different environments.
- **Cloud Deployment**: The application will be hosted on **AWS**, leveraging services like:
  - **AWS ECS** (Elastic Container Service) for deploying Docker containers.
  - **AWS RDS** for PostgreSQL to ensure a managed and scalable database solution.
  - **AWS S3** for static assets and document storage.
  - **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging to ensure system reliability.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implementing a CI/CD workflow using **GitHub Actions** for automated testing and deployment, ensuring rapid and reliable feature releases.

### Data Security Considerations:
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive information, such as passwords, will be hashed using **bcrypt**. Data in transit is secured using **HTTPS**.
- **Role-Based Permissions**: JWT tokens are used to distinguish between lawyers and consumers, ensuring appropriate role-based access.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Both frontend and backend will validate user inputs to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities.
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups of the PostgreSQL database using **AWS RDS snapshots** to prevent data loss.

### Scalability & Performance:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Docker containers can be replicated across multiple instances for horizontal scaling as the user base grows.
- **Load Balancing**: **AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)** will distribute incoming traffic to maintain performance during high load times.
- **Caching**: Use **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data, such as user sessions and requests, to improve response time.

### Technical Challenges & Solutions:
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Implementing Socket.IO effectively for real-time communication between multiple users can be challenging. To manage this, we will use a **Node.js Socket.IO server** in combination with **FastAPI**, ensuring compatibility and performance.
- **Data Consistency**: With a growing number of requests and messages, maintaining data consistency is crucial. Use of database transactions and ACID-compliant operations in PostgreSQL ensures consistency.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by implementing rate limiting at the API gateway, allowing only a certain number of requests per minute from each IP address.

### Future Technical Enhancements:
- **Microservices Architecture**: As the user base grows, consider breaking down the monolithic backend into microservices (e.g., separate services for messaging, requests, and notifications) to enhance maintainability and scalability.
- **AI Integration**: Add features like **natural language processing (NLP)** for analyzing consumer requests and automatically suggesting the best-suited lawyer.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Create an analytics dashboard for lawyers to view metrics such as case volume, response times, and customer satisfaction to help improve their services.

### Summary:
The technical specifications outlined here aim to ensure the Lawyers Collaboration App is secure, scalable, and user-friendly. By leveraging a modern tech stack and cloud infrastructure, the platform is built to handle growing user demand while maintaining data security and providing real-time features.
