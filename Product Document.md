**2. Product Document**

### Overview:
The Lawyers Collaboration App is a platform that connects consumers in need of legal assistance with lawyers who can offer their expertise. It enables consumers to post legal requests, and lawyers can respond by picking up and accepting these requests. Once a lawyer accepts a request, they can communicate with the consumer to provide assistance. The app's main goal is to make legal services more accessible and efficient.

### Key Features:
- **User Registration**: The platform allows both lawyers and consumers to register by providing personal details, which are securely stored. Lawyers can add their specializations and experience during registration.
- **Requests Dashboard**: Consumers can create new requests for legal services, specifying the nature of the issue and any preferences for specialization. Lawyers have a dashboard showing all available requests, which they can filter based on their expertise.
- **Lawyer Profile Management**: Lawyers can manage their profile, including updating their specialization, experience, and availability status, ensuring that consumers see up-to-date information.
- **Consumer-Lawyer Communication**: Once a request is picked, the lawyer and consumer can communicate through a built-in messaging system, allowing them to discuss the details of the legal issue and exchange any required documents.
- **Request Locking**: Once a lawyer accepts a request, it is no longer available to other lawyers. This feature ensures that consumers receive focused and undivided attention from the lawyer who picks their case.

### User Types:
- **Consumers**: Individuals who need legal assistance. They can register on the platform, create requests for legal help, and communicate with lawyers once a request is picked.
- **Lawyers**: Legal professionals who can register, create a profile that showcases their specialization and experience, view open requests, pick requests, and communicate directly with consumers.

### Functional Flow:
1. **User Registration**:
   - Both lawyers and consumers register using a simple registration form, providing necessary details like name, email, and phone number.
   - Users verify their email to complete the registration process, enhancing security and preventing fake accounts.

2. **Request Creation (Consumer)**:
   - Consumers log in to the platform and create requests specifying their legal needs.
   - They provide a brief description of the legal issue, and optionally, their preferred type of lawyer specialization.
   - Created requests are saved in the system, and consumers can track their status from their dashboard.

3. **Request View & Pick (Lawyer)**:
   - Lawyers log in and can view all available consumer requests in their dashboard.
   - Lawyers have the option to filter requests based on their specialization or location to find the most relevant cases.
   - If a lawyer decides to pick a request, the request status is updated, and it becomes locked for that lawyer.

4. **Communication**:
   - Once a request is picked, the lawyer and consumer can start communicating through the messaging system.
   - The platform supports real-time messaging, allowing both parties to ask questions, share updates, and exchange necessary documents related to the case.

5. **Completion**:
   - Once the legal service has been provided, either the lawyer or the consumer can mark the request as completed.
